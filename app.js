/* Part One
What is HTTP?
  HTTP is an application protocol or standard model to interact with the web page.

What is a URL?
  A URL is a web address. It references the location of the web resource it is trying to retrieve.

What is DNS?
  DNS takes the host name found in the url to the corresponding IP address.

What is a query string?
  A query string is in the URL and it sets the parameter of the resource it is looking for.

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
  GET - does not change the data on the server
  POST - changes the data on the server

What is an HTTP request?
  An HTTP request is a request to get a resource on the server. Client to server.

What is an HTTP response?
  The HTTP response is that resource if its successful along with a status. Server to client.

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
  A request header shows what to access and a response header gives back more details on what you get back.
  The request header shows the host and what link the host is referring to.
  The response header has date of when it was last-modified.

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
  Using DNS it finds the IP address from the hostname.
  Requests are made in which more details are specified in the request headers.
  The requests are made to the server, if the resources are found elsewhere than the server makes that request to
  another server and retrieves it for the user.
  The server sends a response to the client.
